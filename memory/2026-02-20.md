## Key Expectations from Andrew

**Consistency in Results:**
- Always verify times/dates/configurations are correct BEFORE confirming to user
- Be explicit about timezones — never use ambiguous UTC conversions
- Double-check all technical details (cron expressions, API keys, schedules) match the request
- Catch and correct errors immediately
- Andrew's default timezone: Singapore (UTC+8)

## Cron Jobs Configured

1. **Daily AI & DevOps News Summary**
   - Schedule: `0 8 * * *` (Asia/Singapore)
   - Time: 8:00 AM SGT daily
   - Recurring: Yes

2. **Ask Andrew clarifying questions on AI products**
   - Schedule: `0 14 21 2 *` (Asia/Singapore)
   - Time: 2:00 PM SGT, February 21
   - Recurring: No (one-time, deletes after run)

## Configuration Done

- Brave Search API key configured for web search
- Both cron jobs use explicit Asia/Singapore timezone
- Guardrails added (RATE LIMITS & BUDGET CONSTRAINTS)

## Guardrails Enforced

**Rate Limits:**
- 5 seconds minimum between API calls
- 10 seconds between web searches
- Max 5 searches per batch, then 2-minute break
- Batch similar work (one request, not many)
- 429 error: STOP, wait 5 minutes, retry

**Budget:**
- Daily: $5 (warn at $3.75)
- Monthly: $25 (warn at $18.75)

See GUARDRAILS.md for full documentation.

## Andrew's Preferences (Documented)

**Document Generation:**
- NO blank pages in PDFs unless explicitly requested
- Optimize for content density
- Avoid unnecessary whitespace or filler
- Use page breaks only when necessary

**Communication:**
- Formal, professional tone
- Gentle reminders preferred
- Accuracy and consistency over speed

**Sub-Agent Communications:**
- Log ALL sub-agent interactions to central repository
- Location: `memory/subagent-communications/`
- Format: JSONL with complete schema (timestamp, task, status, outcome, cost, error)
- Access: Tim logs and references; sub-agents self-log their work; Andrew reviews
- Archival: Move completed tasks to `archive/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`
- Purpose: Transparency, auditability, coordination
- **Sub-agent write access:** Sub-agents write their own status updates, outcomes, errors
- **Update references:** When providing updates, reference specific log files (e.g., `memory/subagent-communications/active/cache-metrics.jsonl`)
