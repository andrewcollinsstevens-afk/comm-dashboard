- **Access:** Tim logs, sub-agents self-log, Andrew reviews via dashboard
- **Query tools:** 10+ jq command examples in QUERY_GUIDE.md
- **Status:** Ready for sub-agent spawning

## Budget Status

- **Anthropic credits remaining:** $24.99 (unchanged from Feb 20)
- **Daily spend estimate:** $0.02–0.03 (from prompt caching at ~90% cost reduction)
- **Brave Search API:** ~3 searches used (~$0.30)
- **Projected monthly spend:** Well under $25 limit

## Critical Next Milestones

**By Feb 21, 2:00 PM SGT (next 6 hours):**
- [ ] Receive clarifying questions response from Andrew
- [ ] Log response to memory/2026-02-21.md

**By Feb 21, 11:55 PM SGT (today, evening):**
- [ ] Run daily cache metrics report
- [ ] Review output for caching efficiency

**By Feb 28, 4:00 PM SGT (7 days):**
- [ ] **CREATE:** Interactive HTML sub-agent communications dashboard
- [ ] **DEPLOY:** Host dashboard (method TBD with Andrew)
- [ ] **RUN:** Dashboard review cron job at 4 PM SGT

## What's Working Well

1. **Prompt caching** — Reduces token costs ~90% on repeated context (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus all enabled with ephemeral control)
2. **Formal, professional tone** — Matches Andrew's DevOps/engineering background; clear, concise, no fluff
3. **Timezone discipline** — All cron jobs use explicit Asia/Singapore (UTC+8); no ambiguity
4. **Sub-agent logging schema** — Self-documenting, machine-queryable, transparent
5. **News cron validation** — Daily news summary confirmed working; good signal of system health

## Configuration & Guardrails

- **Rate limits enforced:** 5s between API calls, 10s between web searches, max 5 searches/batch then 2-min break
- **Budget constraints set:** Warn at $3.75 (daily), $18.75 (monthly)
- **Model fallback chain:** Haiku → Sonnet → Opus → Llama 3.2 (for credit exhaustion resilience)
- **PDF document style:** No blank pages, content-dense, optimized layout (per SOUL.md)
- **Sub-agent write access:** Enabled for real-time self-logging and status updates

## Open Questions for Andrew

(Pending delivery from Feb 21 2 PM cron job)
1. Product prioritization — which AI product to focus on first?
2. Market/positioning — target audience and key differentiators?
3. Metrics — what success looks like (revenue, users, adoption)?
4. Resources — team capacity and constraints?

## Andrew's System Preferences

### Error Handling
- **Silent error handling:** If any error occurs, retry automatically 3 times with 2-minute delays before reporting
- Error logs tracked in `memory/error-logs/` for audit trail
- Never spam Andrew with error messages; resolve silently first
- Only escalate if all 3 retries fail

### Information Management
- **Check before asking:** Always search MEMORY.md and prior context before requesting tokens, credentials, or configurations
- Don't ask for the same information twice
- Review session history first — information likely already provided
- This applies especially to: PAT tokens, API keys, access codes, domain names, etc.

## Notes for Next Session

- Check if clarifying questions were delivered and answered
- Review cache metrics from daily report
- Assess progress on dashboard creation
- Plan Feb 28 dashboard deployment approach with Andrew
- Monitor error-logs/ directory for any escalated failures
