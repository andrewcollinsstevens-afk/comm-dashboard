## 🔄 In Progress

### Awaiting Input
- [ ] **Clarifying questions to Andrew** (scheduled for 2:00 PM SGT tomorrow):
  1. What AI products are currently in development? (Ideation phase or existing?)
  2. What does "execution support" mean in practice? (Code review, research, market validation, project tracking?)
  3. Review cycle frequency? (Weekly? Per milestone?)
  4. Preferred channels for reminders/check-ins? (Telegram, WhatsApp, here?)

## 🎯 Key Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Formal tone | Matches Andrew's professional style |
| Singapore timezone default | Andrew's location; avoid UTC ambiguity |
| Isolated session for cron jobs | Independent execution, cleaner separation |
| Point-form news summaries | Scannable, concise updates on AI/DevOps trends |
| Gentle reminders | Preference stated; reduces friction |
| General heartbeat checks | Sufficient for now; can expand later |
| Consistency commitment | User-requested expectation; critical for reliability |
